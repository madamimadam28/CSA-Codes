/* In this program, you will need to do some basic formatting for an essay on 3 ways heat can be transferred to or from the human body.

The headings in BOLD below will all need to print on a new line and the text body will need to print continuously in paragraph form.
The headings do NOT need to display as bold in the output.
The paragraph text will flow off the output screen in one single line of output and that’s OK.
Be sure to have blank lines after each paragraph as shown below, too.
So your final essay should look something like this output:

Here is the essay:

3 Ways to Regulate Temperature
Each of the 3 methods below is an example of three of the ways the human body regulates its temperature.

Conduction
A type of heat transfer due to contact with another surface, such as sitting on a cold metal chair.

Convection
A type of heat transfer occuring through air or water, such as wading into a cool lake.

Radiation
A type of heat transfer from infrared rays, such as feeling warmer on hot pavement or a hot sidewalk.*/
