/* One way we can use comments is to help us layout our program before we actually type code. For this exercise you are going to create the structure for a Choose Your Own Adventure vacation using only comments.

Your vacation can be to anywhere school appropriate. It should give the user at least two destination options, with at least two activity options for each destination for a total of at least 4 endings.

Here is an abbreviated example to help:

//Intro 

//First choice: Atlantis or Ribe

    // User Chooses Atlantis

        // List Things to do/see in Atlantis
           ...

    // User Chooses Ribe
        ...
Your program should have 10 to 15 comments to help layout the structure. */
